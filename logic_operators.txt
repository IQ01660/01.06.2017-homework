There are 3 types of logical operators. These involve 
&& - and
|| - or
!  - not

We use "and"/ && to list conditions that should all be true in order for the condition to be true
For example:
	> true&&true&&false
	< false

We use "not"/ ! to list conditions that should have just one  true condition in order for the condition to be true
For example:
	> true||true||false
	< true
We use "not"/ ! to ask for the opposite of the written condition
For example:
	> !(true&&false)
	< true
